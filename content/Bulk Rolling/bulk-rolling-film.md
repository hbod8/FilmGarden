<!-- # Bulk Rolling 35mm Film -->

*Bulk Rolling* reffers to taking a length of 35mm film, attaching, rolling and cutting into a standard 35mm casette for use in a stills camera. The history of this dates back to first 35mm camera made by Oskar Barnack in 1913. He took the already standard 35mm format from cinema film and expanded to image to fit horizontally on the film base. Rolling or spooling down existing cinema film was the source of this format and the act of cutting down cinema film can still be done today with the right tools.

### Reasons to bulk roll film

There are three main reasons you would want to choose to roll your own film instead of buying a pre-packed 36 or 24 exposure 35mm cassette.

1. Cheaper per-roll cost
2. Custom length roll (1 - ~40 frames)
3. The film you want is only availible in longer rolls

While all of these things are possible, 1, cheaper per-roll cost, is not always true. After you aquire the tools and materials it can sometimes not be worth the cost savings.

### Reasons you shouldn't bulk roll film

Bulk rolling is not all sunshine and rainbows, ruining a 100ft roll of film due to improper lightsafe tecquniques is entirely possible. Although this is the most common fear there are many more reasons you can find bulk rolling troublesome:

- Worn cassettes cause light leaks
- Improper loading leading to loss of final frame on roll
- Fingerprints on the film caused by manual loading
- Missing sprocket holes from bad rolling tools causing camera lock-up
- Damaged film from bulk rolling tools
- Image artifacts from stress on the film during loading
- Camera fails to pickup the film due to improperly cut leader

Wow! Why am I even doing this if so many things can go wrong? Well, if you're already shooting film you should start to expect a long list of dos and don'ts from existing literature on the subject. My hope in this guide is to pass on my experience bulk rolling film and the habits and rituals I use to avoid all of these problems.

## Materials Needed

This section title is a misnomer. *Needed* is a relative term. You could theoretically take a 100ft length of film, a used casette, and a peice of scotch tape and curl up under a thick blanket in a bathtub with the door closed and spool the film onto the casette, then rip the film with your teeth. So, in that case your needed materials would literally just be scotch tape and some level desparation. But, just as I keep spending my retirement fund on cameras and lenses I don't need, somethimes there are things in life that make it easier and more enjoyable to do things. As such, these sections are relatively ordered in the nessecity of the item required to bulk roll film. I suggest setting a budget and then buying whatever is within that.

### Basic Consumables

#### Empty Film Casette

The best source of these will always be ones that have only been used once and are made from metal by a reputable film company such as Ilford or Kodak. If you develop at home you should have these laying around, or if you get your film develpoed at a lab you can usually ask for the empty ones they're going to throw away or recycle.

The **most important quality** these used casettes need is the correct amount of film sticking out to attach the frech film from your bulk roll. If it is too short you risk admaging the felt or having it detach when you reach the end of your roll in camera.  If it is too long you will loose frames as the end of your roll as you will unknowingly wind the exposed and already used film in front of the shutter.

You can determine the correct length of film needed by setting the casette in the back of your camera (if it's an SLR with an open back loading system), then pulling the film until its tight and seeing how close to the shutter the film gets. It should not be so long that it's within one inch of the shutter.  It should also be not so short that half the width of the tape you're using is within 2-4mm of the felt light seal.

TLDR: The protruding film should be around 3/4 of an inch or 2 cm from the felt lightseal on your casette.
