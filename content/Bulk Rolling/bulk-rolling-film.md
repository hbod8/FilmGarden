<!-- # Bulk Rolling 35mm Film -->

*Bulk Rolling* refers to taking a length of 35mm film, attaching, rolling, and cutting into a standard 35mm cassette for use in a stills camera. The history of this dates back to the first 35mm camera made by Oskar Barnack in 1913. He took the already standard 35mm format from cinema film and expanded the image to fit horizontally on the film base. Rolling or spooling down existing cinema film was the source of this format, and the act of cutting down cinema film can still be done today with the right tools.

### â€‹Reasons to bulk roll film

There are three main reasons you would want to choose to roll your own film instead of buying a pre-packed 36 or 24 exposure 35mm cassette.

1. Cheaper per-roll cost
2. Custom length roll (1 - ~40 frames)
3. The film you want is only available in longer rolls

While all of these things are possible, 1, cheaper per-roll cost, is not always true. After you aquire the tools and materials it can sometimes not be worth the cost savings.

### Reasons you shouldn't bulk roll film

Bulk rolling is not all sunshine and rainbows; ruining a 100ft roll of film due to improper light-safe techniques is entirely possible. Although this is the most common fear, there are many more reasons you can find bulk rolling troublesome:

- Worn cassettes cause light leaks
- Improper loading leading to loss of final frame on roll
- Fingerprints on the film caused by manual loading
- Missing sprocket holes from bad rolling tools causing camera lock-up
- Damaged film from bulk rolling tools
- Image artifacts from stress on the film during loading
- Camera fails to pickup the film due to improperly cut leader

Wow! Why am I even doing this if so many things can go wrong? Well, if you're already shooting film, you should start to expect a long list of dos and don'ts from existing literature on the subject. My hope in this guide is to pass on my experience bulk rolling film and the habits and rituals I use to avoid all of these problems.

## Materials Needed

This section title is a misnomer. ï¿¼ï¿¼*Needed* is a relative term. You could theoretically take a 100ft length of film, a used cassette, and a piece of Scotch tape and curl up under a thick blanket in a bathtub with the door closed and spool the film onto the cassette, then rip the film with your teeth. So, in that case, your needed materials would literally just be Scotch tape and some level of desperation. But, just as I keep spending my retirement fund on cameras and lenses I don't need, sometimes there are things in life that make it easier and more enjoyable to do things. As such, these sections are relatively ordered in the necessity of the item required to bulk roll film. I suggest setting a budget and then buying whatever is within that.

### Basic Consumables

#### Empty Film Cassette

The best source of these will always be ones that have only been used once and are made from metal by a reputable film company such as Ilford or Kodak. If you develop at home, you should have these laying around, or if you get your film developed at a lab, you can usually ask for the empty ones they're going to throw away or recycle.

The **most important quality** these used cassettes need is the correct amount of film sticking out to attach the fresh film from your bulk roll. If it is too short, you risk damaging the felt or having it detach when you reach the end of your roll in the camera.  If it is too long, you will lose frames as the end of your roll as you will unknowingly wind the exposed and already used film in front of the shutter.

You can determine the correct length of film needed by setting the cassette in the back of your camera (if it's an SLR with an open back loading system), then pulling the film until it's tight and seeing how close to the shutter the film gets. It should not be so long that it's within one inch of the shutter.  It should also not be so short that half the width of the tape you're using is within 2-4mm of the felt light seal.

TLDR: The protruding film should be around 3/4 of an inch or 2 cm from the felt light seal on your cassette.

Used cassettes can be had for free in Seattle, with proper length, from:

- Panda Lab
- Shot on Film

The other option is to use ready-to-use bulk loading cassettes.  These are the most common models:

I have used all of these except the "Russian" ones.  Both of the plastic ones gave me horrible light leaks on my first, but always seconds roll of film.  The snap caps are great but usually cost between 3-5$ a cassette which, when compared to free used ones, is a horrible deal.

You will find purpose build reloadable cassettes by Leica and Nikon. Do not be deceived, these are for specific cameras and are known to mangle film anyway.

#### Tape

Really? Tape matters? Yes.

I started out a naive bulk loader using my finest gaffers tape on one side of my film connecting to the leader from the empty roll.  **This is a critical mistake**, gaffer tape, duct tape, or any cloth tape is too thick to fit 36 exposures onto a roll. Any thin film tape will be fine, I use the scotch gift wrapping tape I had in my office supply drawer. For best adhesion apply the tape parallel to the seam between the film and the leader so that you can wrap the edges and tape both sides with one piece.

Tape:
- Scotch Gift Tape
- Any thin film-based tape

#### Scissors

No tricks here, as long as you can cut some small curves (for a leader) it should work great.

#### Daylight Loader

Daylight loaders come in very different sizes and shapes with many different features. They all have their own problems and this is no clear winner.

Do I really need a daylight loader? Probably, it's the main piece of gear for this process and where the greatest amount of your bulk loading budget should be spent the first time. I recommend taking the amount of film you have shot in the past and using that to determine how much to spend.  Here's what I did:

I shot 78 rolls in the past year.
16 of those were Kodak Gold 200
~30 were black and white Ilford films
I could replace those 30 and 16 with 2 and 1 100' rolls of color and black and white film, probably more if I stopped buying every cool looking film stock at Glazers.

So ~5 100' rolls a year

So I can calculate the cost of my bulk roller in a year per roll as 5 *** 20 (rolls per 100')

So if I spent $120 on my bulk loader that's $1.20/roll which is usually half of the cost savings you'd get by bulk rolling (more on that later). *Probably not worth it.*
